## Introduction
Welcome to the Taco Cloud Git repository! This repository is dedicated to the development of the Taco Cloud project, a fictional system for ordering and enjoying delicious tacos.

## Chapter 1: Getting Started
In the previous chapter, we laid the groundwork for the Taco Cloud project by setting up the initial project directory, defining key components, and outlining the project's architecture.

## Chapter 2: Exploring Data and Templates
In chapter 2, we dive into essential topics, including:
- Understanding the browser's data representation model
- Input validation and processing
- Selecting a library of view templates

These aspects are crucial for building a robust and user-friendly Taco Cloud application.

## Chapter 3: Working with Databases
Summary:
- `JdbcTemplate` greatly simplifies working with JDBC.
- `PreparedStatementCreator` and `KeyHolder` can be used together to retrieve generated database identifiers.
- Spring Data JDBC and Spring Data JPA simplify working with relational databases by reducing it to defining repository interfaces.

## Chapter 4: Non-Relational Databases and Annotations
In this chapter, we expanded our database knowledge to include non-relational databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra. Key points include:
- Spring Data supports repositories for a variety of NoSQL databases, including Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.
- The model programming for creating repositories varies little between databases.
- Working with non-relational databases requires an understanding of data modeling and database storage.
